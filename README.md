# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS LIZARD SPOCK

This website is designed to allow the user to play against the computer in a game of rock paper scissors lizard spock. Many people would be familiar with the game as it was popularised by the tv show the big bang theory, however it was created by Sam Kass in 1998.

## UX

The two main colours used are black, and white.

I used font awesome to add icons to the page.

The main header for the page uses an italic font-style.

The colour red is used

## Features

The icons visible on the page are clickable buttons that when clicked will register that icon as the users choice in the game.

The computer will generate a random number and make a choice, it will then compare your choice and the computers and determine the winner.

The site will play a minimum of three games before determining a winner.

After a game is completed the user is prompted with a play again button. 

The website is fully responsive and works on all device sizes.

There is a rules button which when clicked displays the rules of the game to the user.

## Future Features

In the future I would like to add a multiplayer option to the game which would allow users to play against other users such as their friends
